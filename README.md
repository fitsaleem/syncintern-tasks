delighted to make you an offer as a ReactJs Intern.

# Tasks

# Week 1

**Task 1**

**Create Weather App.**

A weather application that provides detailed weather details for a location specified by the user. 
Built using React and Open Weather API for showing latest weather data. Here we have search options with city and country for which we would like to see weather forecast. 
We will use the fetch method to fetch the API calls along with the React hooks and conditional rendering



# Week 2

**Task 2**

**Create a Messenger App**

An offshoot of this type of realtime app would be a messenger-style app like that of WhatsApp.
This app would be a little bit more limited in that conversations are usually done with one person, although they don't have to be. Instead of talking in channels you will have different options to talk with one or another person at a time. A good touch would be to add notifications when someone messages you. 
This is another app example that would require real time data functionality from your database. Firebase is always a good option for that.
If Firebase gets boring, you could try Supabase which is a very competitive alternative also with realtime database features, but which is backed by Postgres instead of Firestore.


# Week 3

**Task 3**

**Resume Builder Web Application**
